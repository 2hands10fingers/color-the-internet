Color the internet. Combines Python and Web Code to produce a data visualization of datapoints received from incoming internet packets. This is currently a work in progress, but done for now. Feel free to contribute!

### Package key:

Size = frame length + tcp length*.
Animation speed = velcoity at which the packet came through relative to the previous one.
Color = A combination of ethernet distribituion data
Transparency = Artbitratily picked the ethernet source
Ring color = Protocol

*tcp length not added for other protocols

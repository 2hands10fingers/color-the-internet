Color the internet. Combines Python and Javascript to produce a data visualization of datapoints received from incoming internet packets. This is currently a work in progress.

## Currently
- Refining attributes given to each generated shape.
- Refactoring the ridiculous `variancechecker()` to append correct velocities, account for missing numbers, quit looking so ugly.
- Fine-tune the velocity calculations
- Eating pasta, not sleeping enough
